How to run:
-On Windows: cladegenerator.exe
-With Python: cladegenerator.py (Dependencies: javaobj-py3, pyglet, Pillow)



This program generates a historic clade diagram based on the backups of a biogeneis save. A save interval of 5-20
typically works best.

Upon startup, select the directory where the desired world's backups are contained. The files will be read and indexed
then cached. This will take a while the first time, especially with larger worlds, but they will load much faster on
following runs. After the files are loaded, the clade diagram will be generated and saved to 'clade.png' in the world's
folder.



This program is very early in devleopment. Expect potential bugs and crashes. More features are to come.
